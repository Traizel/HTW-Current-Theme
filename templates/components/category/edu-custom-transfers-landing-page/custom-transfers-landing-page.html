    <h2>Custom Printed Heat Transfers</h2>
    <p>We take your artwork and print it on our heat transfer vinyl using our HP Latex printers. We then use our Graphtec Cutter to contour cut around your artwork and then weed away the excess material. All designs using this method will have an outline (usually white). This then allows us to mask your material, making it press ready. Once you receive your designs, all you need to do is press them onto your garments! These transfers can be pressed as low as 266°F and as high as 320°F depending on what material you are pressing on.</p>

    <p>Custom Rhinestones are a great way to add bling to your garments! If you have a logo or design and would like it done fully in rhinestones, just send us your design and we will create it for you! We use 3 different size rhinestones and have many colors to choose from. We take your artwork and mock it up in our rhinestone software which is then sent to our machines that place those stones onto a sticky mask. We make sure all stones are bright and face the correct way which ensures that you have a stress free time pressing them on to your garments. We use high-quality DMC rhinestones which will make your design POP and sparkle.</p>

    <h2>Custom Dye Sublimation Transfers</h2>
    <p>Dye sublimation transfers are very different from heat transfer vinyl. Instead of heat pressing a vinyl onto a garment, dye sublimation puts gas ink into the material. After pressing the transfer on to the garment, the texture is the same as when you started. Dye sublimation transfers work best with 100% polyester white garments or dye sublimation blanks. Dye sublimation transfers can be pressed on darker garments, however, use caution when pressing on really dark garments as the transfer may not be visible. </p>
